While doing part one, we have the price info
from each of 2000 Secrets of every buyer
Then find top three highest prices, and thier code 
(four digit num)
 
make get highest three value codes method
and a get code method
to do that, i should get the index of the highest value
at greater than, so no repeats of highest
throw an exception if the code of that value is already
been seen in the priceList
